        # snake segment
        snake_body.append( new_segment )

    # *** ENHANCEMENTS ***
    # * Changing the game background.
    # * Can you figure out how to change the color of each snake segment?
    #   Hint: use the Segment class' constructor
    # * Changing the food from a square to an image, like a pizza?
    # * Can you make the game faster the more food the snake eats?
    #   Hint: use the frameRate() function
