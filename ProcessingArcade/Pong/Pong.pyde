    # 7. Call the ball object's update() and draw() methods.
    #    Do you see the ball moving on the screen?


    # 8. Call the paddle object's update() and draw() methods.
    #    Do you see the paddle on the screen?


    # 9. Finish the code in keyPressed() and keyReleased() first!
    
    # 12. Call the ball object's collision(paddle) method and pass the
    #     paddle object as an input variable.
    #     Does the ball bounce off the paddel?

    # 13. End the game when the ball goes below the bottom of the screen.
    #     You can use noLoop() to freeze the game and text() to print text
    #     on the screen.

    # 14. Figure out how to add a score to the game so every bounce off
    #     the paddle increases the player socre
    #     *HINT* use an if statement when checking the ball's collison
    #            with the paddle

    # *EXTRA*
    # Can you figure out how to make a 2 player pong game with paddles on
    # the left and right on the screen?
